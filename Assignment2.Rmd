## One factor ANOVA example from Dobson's book, cf. Table 7.4:

The average weight of the control group is `r mean(PlantGrowth[PlantGrowth$group=="ctrl",1])` while the second treatment group's average was `r mean(PlantGrowth[PlantGrowth$group=="trt2",1])`.

```{r code }
boxplot(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, main = "PlantGrowth data",
        ylab = "Dried weight of plants", col = "lightgray",
        notch = FALSE, varwidth = TRUE)
anova(lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth))
```
